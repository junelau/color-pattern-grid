## What This Application Does

This is an **interactive color pattern generator** that creates and displays decorative patterns in a 14×6 grid (84 squares total). The application:

- **Generates 4 pre-made patterns** using different algorithms (Diagonal, Random, Bug-Eye, Log Cabin)
- **Allows manual editing** - click any square to change its color via a popup picker with keyboard shortcuts (1-7)
- **Includes a sandbox area** for creating custom random patterns that can be named and saved
- **Enforces color balance** - each of the 7 colors should appear exactly 12 times per pattern
- **Provides real-time validation** showing which colors are over/under represented
